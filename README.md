**SULLEY** stands for **Symmetry Understanding of Local Frames for Learning Equivariant geometrY**. This project focuses on developing a framework to find local frames for each atom in a molecule, allowing for the accurate description of their electrostatic multipoles.

## Objective

The primary goal of SULLEY is to identify the local frames of each atom, facilitating the description of their multipole characteristics. By leveraging these local frames, the project aims to enhance the learning of multipoles in an equivariant manner.

## Methodology

SULLEY draws inspiration from existing methodologies, particularly the Poltype framework, utilizing a possibility tree approach to model the local frames effectively. This will enable a structured exploration of atomic environments and their interactions.

## Key Features

- **Equivariant Learning**: The local frames will be used to train neural networks in a way that respects the symmetries of the molecular system.
- **Efficiency**: By optimizing the representation of local frames, SULLEY aims to create a much faster neural network for learning multipoles, significantly improving computational performance.

## Applications

SULLEY's approach is intended for applications in fields such as computational chemistry and molecular dynamics, where understanding electrostatic interactions at the atomic level is crucial.

## Installation

Instructions for installation will be provided soon.

## Project Status

The project is currently under development and ongoing research. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
